# gpudash

The `gpudash` command displays a GPU utilization dashboard for the last hour:

```
usage: gpudash_ [-h] [-u NETID] [-n] [-c]

GPU utilization dashboard for the last hour

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -u NETID         create dashboard for a single user
  -n, --no-legend  flag to hide the legend
  -c, --cryoem     flag to show cryoem nodes

Utilization is the percentage of time during a sampling window (< 1 second) that
a kernel was running on the GPU. The format of each entry in the dashboard is
username:utilization (e.g., aturing:90). Utilization varies between 0 and 100%.

Examples:

  Show dashboard for all users:
    $ gpudash

  Show dashboard for the user aturing:
    $ gpudash -u aturing

  Show dashboard for all users without displaying legend:
    $ gpudash -n

  Show dashboard for the cryoem nodes:
    $ gpudash -c

  Show dashboard for the cryoem nodes for user aturing:
    $ gpudash -c -u aturing
```

## Notes

For `jdh4`, nothing lives in `/tigress/jdh4/python-devel` so use wget to push the code to della, tiger and traverse. Added ssh key between della-gpu and della8 on Dec 11, 2021.
